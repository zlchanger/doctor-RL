<|im_start|>user\nTask: As a medical expert, evaluate the semantic similarity between the model-generated medical text and the ground truth reference. 
Score on a 0â€“5 point scale based on meaning alignment (wording differences are acceptable if meaning matches).

Criteria:
5: Identical meaning (different wording okay).
4: Minor wording/detail differences; overall meaning aligned.
3: Partial meaning overlap; important differences exist but core intent is partially shared.
2: Limited meaning overlap; key details or context differ significantly.
1: Minimal meaning overlap; mostly unrelated or only superficially related.
0: Unrelated or completely different meaning (no meaningful semantic connection).

Now evaluate:
Models' Prediction: "{candidate}"
Ground-truth: "{reference}"
